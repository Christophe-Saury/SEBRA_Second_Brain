# SEBRA_Second_Brain
Second Brain is a UI/UX design project built for my UI/UX design class at Sogang University in Seoul, Korea.

**Summary of the work done :**

“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — Carl Jung

Our why :
We believe that in life it is key to be aware of what you do on a daily basis to be able to strive to be better than you were the previous day.
Unfortunately, it can be hard to track every aspect of our life as the data is usually separated into different apps

Identified problem :
When it comes to goals and new years resolutions, according to a survey conducted by forbes health, only 8% of respondents tend to stick with their goals for one month, while 22% last two months, 22% last three months and 13% last four months.
For the people trying to achieve their goals, their are some factors that make it more harder for them to do so.
People tend to have different apps for tracking tracking exercise, walking, activity, expenses in the day, tracking sleep, location, pictures, screen time, study time. It can be annoying to switch from one to the other. 

Solution :
An app that could centralize this data, summarize it and cross-reference it would be extremely helpful. Such an app could also serve other causes.
We made user stories and personas that would match the different use cases of such an app.

Summary :
- Data is stored on too many different platforms, need one to bring it all together
- If data is centralized, we can cross-reference the data for a better analysis
- Data can be categorized to only have the data pertaining to the user's specific goals at the moment
- We can provide summaries and recommendations based on the data to help the user achieve their goals
